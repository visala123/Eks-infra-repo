##  Note
Create S3 bucket in aws console manually and update the name in backend S3 script and in the secrets. 

Before pushing the code to the `main` branch, update the repository secrets:

**GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret**

Add the following:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` ‚Äì your AWS access key ID  
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` ‚Äì your AWS secret key  
- `BUCKET_TF_STATE` ‚Äì S3 bucket name for the Terraform state file

## üîÑ CI/CD Workflow Overview

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to provision infrastructure and configure Amazon EKS using Terraform. It also sets up Argo CD automatically.

###  Trigger Conditions
This workflow is triggered:
- On push to `main` or `stage` branches
- On pull request to `main` (if files inside `terraform/` are changed)

###  Job 1: `terraform` ‚Äì Provision EKS Infrastructure

- Initializes Terraform and remote backend (S3)
- Validates, formats, and creates Terraform plans
- Applies infrastructure changes on the `main` branch
- Configures AWS and updates kubeconfig for EKS
- Deploys NGINX Ingress Controller to the cluster

###  Job 2: `install_argocd` ‚Äì Deploy Argo CD to EKS

- Authenticates with AWS and updates kubeconfig
- Deploys Argo CD using the official manifest
- Waits for Argo CD server to be ready
- Exposes Argo CD via a `LoadBalancer` service
- Outputs the LoadBalancer DNS of the Argo CD UI

You can access the Argo CD UI using the DNS printed in the last step.

##  Destroy Infrastructure

To clean up all provisioned resources, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init        # if not already initialized
terraform destroy
‚ö†Ô∏è This will delete all AWS resources provisioned by this repository, including EKS, ECR, and VPC components.
